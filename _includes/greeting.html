    <h1>My Journey</h1>
    <h2><br>All of us can share moments with the world. In sharing these moments, we allow others to form opinions which may be critical or negative. Expecting universal acceptance of an idea is naively assuming we all think alike. Know and live your boundaries.<br><br> Learning and growth from positive or unfortunate experiences can be much stronger takeaways than explaining your actions to the world.</h2>
